Python tasks
This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables. I have used python for doing the visualizations and creating a linear regression model.
The python code is done to predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours. Also, I calculated the predicted score of a student who studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?
